You look on the night stand next to you and you see a letter. It reads "You have been taken and now trapped in the world called Zoldas! If you wish to leave you must find a key which unlocks a moving hidden door, find the door, and escape. If you do not wish to do so, you will be stuck here for eternity and go insane from boredom. Goodluck Traveler!" This is where your journey begins~')
