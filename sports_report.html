    Matt Murray skated on his own Friday at the Pittsburgh Penguins' practice facility in Cranberry, Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.

The 23-year-old goaltender has missed Pittsburgh's past two games after being diagnosed with a concussion on Tuesday, one day after being hit in the head by a shot from defenseman Olli Maatta at practice. He is still listed as out indefinitely.

Murray is 23-13-2 with a 2.82 goals-against average and .909 save percentage. Tristan Jarry (10-5-2, 2.73 GAA,.912 save percentage) and Casey DeSmith  (3-4-0, 2.73 GAA, .913 save percentage) have shared goaltending duties in Murray's absence.

The Penguins (36-25-4) are third in the Metropolitan Division, two points behind the second-place Philadelphia Flyers, and host the New York Islanders on Saturday (5 p.m. ET, ATTSN-PG, MSG+, NHL.TV).

    Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard JR Smith was suspended for Thursday night's 108-97 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers because he reportedly threw a bowl of soup at assistant coach Damon Jones, according to ESPN.com's Brian Windhorst and Dave McMenamin.

Two hours before tipoff, the Cavaliers announced Smith had been suspended one game for detrimental conduct.

Head coach Tyronn Lue addressed the discipline prior to the game but did not go into specifics.

"Something happened after shootaround," he told reporters.

Smith is scheduled to be back at practice Friday before the Cavaliers host the Denver Nuggets on Saturday at Quicken Loans Arena.

A 14-year veteran, Smith is averaging 8.3 points on 39.2 percent shooting from the field and 36.3 percent shooting from three this season.

After three largely underwhelming seasons, Jimmy Graham is reportedly set to leave the Seattle Seahawks.

Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reported a "bunch" of teams will pursue Graham, but the Seahawks are not expected to be one.

Graham, 31, spent the last three seasons in Seattle after coming over in a 2015 blockbuster trade that was supposed to make the Seahawks offense more dynamic. Instead, Graham saw his production taper off in a major way from his heights in New Orleans

After recording at least 85 receptions and 889 yards from 2011-14, Graham never had more than 65 receptions and averaged 682.7 yards per season in Seattle. He recorded 57 receptions for 520 yards and 10 scores in 2017, his first season averaging less than 10 yards per catch.
